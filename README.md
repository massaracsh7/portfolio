## About The Project

![Screen ](public/screen.png)

My portfolio shares my work as a Frontend Developer focused on building smooth and user-friendly digital experiences. 'Who Am I?' tells a bit about my background, and 'What I've Built' shows projects that highlight my skills in design and functionality. 'Let's Connect' is for networking and collaboration, while 'My Toolbox' lists the skills and tools I use regularly. Finally, 'My Learning Journey' shares my ongoing growth as I learn more about web development.
